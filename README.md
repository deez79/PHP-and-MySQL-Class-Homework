Homework for PHP and MySQL Class

This is my first homework assignment for a php and mysql class.  

The assignment is to create a sticky form, that if submitted incomplete holds the values entered.

In it's original form, js is used to check if all required imputs are met. I have attempted php validation, however,
I am not finished with a thorough validation.  On initial commit, the validation was only that data was entered.  
Data has not been sanitised.

Upcoming Goals:
=================

1. Use $_POST instead of $_REQUEST for all variables created

2. ~~~Figure out how to call variables from forms.php to sucess.php~~

3. Create validation function using SWITCH
